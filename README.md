## Built With

This Unity project uses the following:

* [Unity 2019.2.9f1](https://unity3d.com/es/get-unity/download/archive)
* [Oculus Integration 13.0](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022)
* Oculus Link needed

This script can be used without Oculus Integration as it can record and recognize any configuration of positions in a tree of objects.
